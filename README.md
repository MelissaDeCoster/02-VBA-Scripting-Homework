02-VBA-Scripting Homework

I chose to complete the 'Hard' homework plus the challenge. My code loops though the all the sheets and creates the two requested summaries on each sheet. For your convenience I have included my code as a .bas file and as a .txt file. While I was testing I also created a little code snippet to re-set the workbook, this is included in the same module in its own sub procedure. It deletes the summaries and adjusts the columns back to original width and color.

Please see the attached three screen shots, one for each year tab.
