02-VBA-Scripting Homework

I chose to complete the 'Hard' homework plus the challenge. My code loops though the all the sheets and creates the two requested summaries on each sheet. For your convenience I have included my code as a .bas file and as a .txt file. Finally while I was testin a created a little code snippet to re-set the workbook. It deletes the summaries and adjusts the columns back to original width and color.

Please see the attached three screen shots, one for each year tab.
